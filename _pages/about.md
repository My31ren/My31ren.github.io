Welcome to Dr. Mengyuan Ren's academic webpage! Here this page is established to record my academic path, experiences, and achievements. You can also have a quick access knowing me. My major is epidemiology and biostatistics. I just received my Ph.D degree in Peking University with the supervision of Dr. Bin Wang at the Institute of Reproductive and Child Health, School of Public Health, Peking University. During my Ph.D candidate period, I was fully trained with multi-disciplinaries including **epidemiology**, **health statistics**, and **environmental science**. Now I'm working as a postdoc at RSPH in Emory University with the supervision of Dr. Donghai Liang. 
My research interest includes exploring the effects and mechanisms of environmental factors on human health using **multi-omics** approaches, including but are not limited to **exposome**, and **metabolome**. Recently, I focus on establishing integrated analytical framework on identifying disease-specific sensitive biomarkers among environmental exposures in mixture, we will work with collegues and collaborators on diverse exciting projects using multi-omics data to investigate how environmental exposures influcence maternal and child health outcomes through omics approaches. 
I have published **24** papers at the top international journals such as *Environ. Int.*, *The Innovation*,...   <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wk035rcAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

[Ascertaining Sensitive Exposure Biomarkers of Various Metal(loid)s to Embryo Implantation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123679)

**Mengyuan Ren**, Tianxiang Wu, Shuo Yang, ... Bin Wang*, Mingliang Fang.

[**Highlight**]
- Close relations exist between metals exposure and embryo implantation failure (EIF).
- Identifying sensitive metal biomarkers and exploring mechanisms for EIF is crucial.
- We built a framework for sensitive biomarkers screening with integrated information.
- Four out of 272 candidates were identified as sensitive metal biomarkers for EIF.
- Diverse pathways were identified as potential mechanisms for these biomarkers on EIF.

[Applying Hair Exposome for Linking Environmental Exposure to Reproductive Health: A Comprehensive Review and Research Perspective](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heha.2023.100086)

**Mengyuan Ren**, Mingliang Fang, Jing Liu, ... Bin Wang*.

[**Highlight**]
- Environmental exposures have close relationship with reproductive health.
- Hair exposome has huge potential and demands in health risk assessment studies.
- Reliability of hair to represent exposure and effect biomarkers is of high concern.
- Reliable hair biomarker database based on previous literatures was established.
- Analytical framework on hair exposome for reproductive health was proposed.
